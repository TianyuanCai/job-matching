At Opendoor, we’re on a mission to make it simple to buy and sell homes. The traditional process is broken, with an average home taking over days to sell and costing thousands of dollars. We empower everyone with the freedom to move by making buying and selling a home stress free and instant.

With Covid , the world is changing, and real estate is no exception. The coming years present a tremendous opportunity for innovation as we explore new frontiers and scale nationwide. About the team In the past five years, Opendoor has expanded rapidly to cities and buys and sells billions of dollars of homes per year. But, our vision is to empower everyone with the freedom to move, which necessitates making the Opendoor experience more affordable, consistent, and customer friendly in existing markets, while we also expand our coverage into new markets. The Operations Excellence team reports to the President of Homes & Services and is responsible for driving many of Opendoor’s most complex and cross functional priorities from inception to scale. We use technology and process improvement to refine a very complex operating model that powers “the freedom to move”. Our scope spans the minute a home seller receives an offer from Opendoor, ends with our reselling each home we buy to the next customer, and touches hundreds of processes in between from inspecting each home before we buy it, to renovating homes to we own, to negotiating contract terms with buyers. We make both linear and step change improvements to continue to elevate how we serve customers across all of our existing markets, and expand our core platform and adjacent products (e.g., Buy with Opendoor, Mortgage) to additional markets.

You’re experienced in designing analyses to prove or disprove hypotheses, and you look to data not only for the “what” (“what’s happening in our business?”) but the “so what” (“why does this matter and what is it telling us about potential next steps?”) A systems thinker: you’re a strategic thinker who can go deep on a business and understand its core drivers; you’re also biased to action and know that the true test of an idea comes when we try it out in the real world. Highly collaborative: You’re excited about working across all of our regions and across all levels of the organization: with our leadership team, our functions, our G Ms, and our city operations teams. You’re comfortable not just surfacing data driven insights but communicating them effectively as well.

Send any questions to jobs@bebraven.org. Applications submitted via email will not be accepted. Please do not email the hiring manager. Braven: The Challenge In America, we’ve promised that hard work and ambition will be met with equality of opportunity. The reality is that we have a quiet crisis on our hands. Before COVID , an African American with a BA was twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterpart, and a Bachelor’s degree holder from a low income background started their career earning only two thirds as much as those from higher income backgrounds. While education has the potential to be the great equalizer, only % of our country’s . million first generation or low income college enrollees are predicted to land a strong job after graduation and be on a path to the American Dream. And with the COVID crisis upon us, now more than ever, college students from humble beginnings need to be prepared to compete for strong jobs. Our Vision We believe that our country’s next generation of leaders will emerge from everywhere, but they need a talent strategy that matches them in strength and diversity. We envision an American Dream Team— , diverse leaders in the making—prepared to access and thrive in strong first jobs after college graduation. Theory of Action Braven supports untapped students from college to career by partnering with universities, employers, and college success organizations to offer a two part experience that begins with a credit bearing college course followed by a post course experience that lasts through graduation. Fellows emerge from Braven with the skills, experiences and networks they need to land a strong first job and get on a path to economic freedom. Braven has worked with more than , students at four campuses at Rutgers University Newark, San José State, Lehman College, and National Louis University to date. Outcomes Braven Fellows across the country are persisting in college and achieving exciting levels of internship and job attainment. % of our Fellows are persisting in or have graduated from college. % of Braven college graduates have at least one internship during college, compared with % of first generation seniors at large state universities, and Braven Fellows outpace the national average for strong job attainment. Within six months of graduation, % of Fellows secured quality full time jobs worthy of their Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in graduate school, compared to % of all students and % of students from similar backgrounds. We believe Braven is a solution and we are on a mission to scale it, equalizing access to the American Dream. The Role: Braven is seeking to hire a self driven, creative, and disciplined problem solver to join the Data team as a Data Analyst. The Data Analyst will support the execution and growth of Braven by helping to run, maintain, and improve Braven’s programmatic evaluation systems and processes. Your responsibilities will include data collection, storage, analysis, and reporting. The data you will work with includes program engagement data from our core Accelerator and post Accelerator programs and a wide range of data on Braven Fellow outcomes, including job and internship attainment, college persistence, and growth in non cognitive skills. The ideal candidate for this role should see themselves as equal parts data expert and strategy advisor. You will not only conduct analyses on our programs and outcomes, but you will also translate these findings into insights and recommendations to help inform internal program design and execution. Finally, you will build reports and presentations for external stakeholders such as donors, university and employer partners, and the broader higher education community. To be successful at Braven during this phase of growth, on the Data team and in this role, you must demonstrate Braven’s core values, be comfortable navigating ambiguity, approach problems with curiosity, have a bias to action, and welcome feedback.

Research external benchmarks for the outcomes Braven cares most about (e.g. quality job attainment rates for recent college graduates). Note that the exact data points we are interested in are not always readily available, so this requires more than internet research. You may need to contact research institutions or academics directly to ask for specific cuts of data, and you should feel comfortable merging multiple sources of data and making defensible assumptions to arrive at estimates. Keep close tabs on all research and thought leadership related to Braven’s work (e.g. college enrollment, persistence, the college to career pathway, early career), and synthesize research for team members to inform their work and compel funders and other stakeholders to understand the problem Braven is trying to solve. Provide Data Support to Program Execution Teams (~ % of time) Our program teams across our four university partners need data to make their work as effective and efficient as possible. Oftentimes, our support with data collection, management, or analysis can streamline their work in meaningful ways.
