Since , Indigo has questioned agriculture's full value chain to improve grower profitability, environmental sustainability, and consumer health. The company’s scientific discoveries and digital innovations have amplified new value from soil to sale, benefiting more than , growers to date. Indigo is also the company behind The Terraton Initiative, a global effort to drawdown one trillion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide by unlocking the potential of agricultural soils. In , Indigo was ranked # on CNBC’s Disruptor list. Headquartered in Boston, MA, Indigo has additional offices in Memphis, TN; Research Triangle Park, NC; Sydney, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Basel, Switzerland; and São Paulo, Brazil. The Soil Carbon Science team, an interdisciplinary group of scientists at the heart of Indigo’s carbon credit program, is looking to hire a statistician to quantify the climate benefits of adopting regenerative land management practices. Crucial to Indigo’s program is creating a scalable way to measure changes in soil carbon and trace gas emissions across vast landscapes. To identify causal effects, these emissions must also be estimated in a counterfactual world where growers did not change their practices.
